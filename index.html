            <p>I am from Utah and come from a rural background. I am working hard to pass this course with high marks.
                Although a lot of this new work is not in my normal wheelhouse, I am trying my best to learn. 
                My current skills are in HTML, CSS, JavaScript. I am also a Business Analyst and a SCRUM Master.</p>

        <p>
            This calculator project was built using JavaScript.
            It performs basic arithmetic with 2 numbers. For now, it only has basic operations including addition, subtraction, 
            multiplication, and division.

            As a Business Analyst, I made sure to assist my team and direct them to the needed answers. I made sure that they had clear directions and 
            knew were to go next. I helped to remove any roadblocks in their way.
