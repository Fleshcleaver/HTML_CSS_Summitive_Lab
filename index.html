                I am from Utah and come from a rural background. I am working hard to pass this course with high marks.
                Although a lot of this new work is not in my normal wheelhouse, I am trying my best to learn.
                My current skills are in HTML, CSS, JavaScript. I am also a Business Analyst and a SCRUM Master.

                This calculator project was built using JavaScript.
                It performs basic arithmetic with 2 numbers including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

                As a Business Analyst, I assisted my team and directed them toward the answers they needed. I ensured they
                had clear directions and knew where to go next. I helped remove any roadblocks in their way.
